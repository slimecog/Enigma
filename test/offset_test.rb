#The date of message transmission is also factored into the encryption
#Consider the date in the format DDMMYY, like 020315
#Square the numeric form (412699225) and find the last four digits (9225)
#The first digit is the “A offset” (9)
#The second digit is the “B offset” (2)
#The third digit is the “C offset” (2)
#The fourth digit is the “D offset” (5)
